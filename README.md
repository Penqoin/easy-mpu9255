# EASY MPU9255
This library allows you to use almost all of the MPU-9255 features in a simple and easy way.

This library can for example give you the raw temperature, gyroscope, magnometer and accelorometer data. It can also convert that data into usefull units that can be used in your experiments.



## FEATURES
  * read raw sensor data
  * automatically converts the raw sensor data into more usefull data
  * allows adjustment of the gyroscope, accelorometer and magnometer
  * hast auto calibration for all sensors
  * allows easy motion interrupt capabilites
  * allows the enabeling and disabeling of sensors



## INSTALLATION
  1. Download the library (Clone or Download)
  2. Launch the Arduino IDE
  3. Go to: sketch -> include library then select "add .zip library"
  4. Navigate to the folder where you saved the library
  5. YOU ARE DONE!
